# Javascript Starter Pack

hello there, I'm trying to teach JS to some of my co-workers who are interested, so I've decided to create this repo and archive all examples here.
you can find examples of each session in the session branch.
you can find branches guide at the table below

| **Branch name** | **Files**            |
| :-------------: | -------------------- |
|    session 1    | variables, functions |
|    session 2    | this, datatypes, if-statement, loop, nullish values, logical-operators |
